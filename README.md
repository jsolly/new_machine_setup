### New Machine? Don't want to spend endless hours manually installing and configuring applications and settings? Look no Further!!

- Step 1: Clone this repo and move .zhrc to your $HOME directory. Usually this is in ~/
- Step 2: Follow this guide to enable git autocompletion https://oliverspryn.blog/adding-git-completion-to-zsh/
- Step 3: You might run into this issue, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13762280/zsh-compinit-insecure-directories
- Step 4: run install.sh **(MAKE SURE YOU CHECK OUT INSTALL.SH FIRST TO SEE WHAT IT IS INSTALLING!!)**
* Step 5 - Open Terminal preferences. Make sure:
    * Make sure text antialiasing is turned on
    * Change font to 'Source Code Pro' which we just installed
    * Make font size larger? (I like 24)
